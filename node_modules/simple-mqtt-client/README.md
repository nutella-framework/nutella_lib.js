# Simple MQTT Client

This library was born to offer a consistent API to JS programmers that need an MQTT client for both node.js and the browser.
It leverages the excellent [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) for node.js and [Paho.js](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/) for the browser.

- MQTT.js version: 1.1.3
- Paho.js version: 1.0.1

**IMPORTANT!**
Both libraries ship with this client. In particular paho ships with the library inside the `paho` folder.
When we will inevitably have to update it remember to add
```javascript
module.exports=Paho.MQTT;
```
at the very end of the file to export the module in CommonJS
